        "description": "This lovely, powerful wine is very similar to the Lee Vineyard bottling, but slightly more backward. The fruit and spice aromas are a little earthier, like sniffing a handful of rich, moist humus. In the mouth, there’s just a tad more tannin, indicating, possibly, slightly longer ageability, while the finish is a bit harder. Nonetheless, this is terrific Pinot Noir, among the best anywhere",
